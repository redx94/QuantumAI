# QuantumAI Deployment Documentation

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for deploying the QuantumAH application, including containerization, orchestration, and scaling strategies to support both development and production environments.

## Deployment Architecture
- **Containerization**:
  - Uses Docker to package the application consistently across environments.
  - Supports repeatable and orchestrated containers for flexible scoping.
- **Cloud Integration**:

  - Designed to interface with cloud-based quantum simulators and high-performance AI clusters.
  - Supports secure authentication and secret management through encrypted storage and automated key distribution.

## Docker Deployment

### Dockerfile Example
Create a `Dockerfile` at the repository root:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.tx `./app 
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port (if applicable)
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMT ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Building & Running the Image
- **Build the Image**:

```bash
docker build t quantumai:latest
```
- **Run the Container**:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 quantumai:latest
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Create a Kubernetes deployment file at `deployment/k8s_deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: quantumai-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: quantumai
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: quantumai
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: quantumai
        image: quantumai:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: ENVIRONMENT
          value: "production"
```

## Secure Deployment
- Authorization and secret management via Kubernetes.
- Separation of environment specific settings.
