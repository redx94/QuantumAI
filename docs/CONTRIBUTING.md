   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t quantumai:latest .
   ```
6. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 quantumai:latest
   ```

### Additional Setup Steps
