# QuantumAI Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive testing strategies for ensuring robustness, accuracy, and security across all components of the QuantumAI project.

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- **Quantum Circuits**: Verify circuit configurations, gate operations, and simulation outputs.
- **AI Models**: Test training routines, inference accuracy, and model integration.
- **Cryptographic Utilities**: Validate encryption, decryption, and hash functions.

### Integration Testing
- **Workflow Simulation**: Ensure smooth data flow from quantum simulation to AI inference and cryptographic processing.
- **Interface Validation**: Check data consistency and timing at module boundaries.

### Stress Testing
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high-throughput scenarios to assess performance under stress.
- **Error Injection**: Introduce controlled quantum errors and network latency to evaluate system resilience.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track performance metrics (latency, throughput, resource usage) under sustained load.

### Testing Tools & Frameworks
- **Python `unittest`/`pytest`**: For systematic unit and integration testing.
- **Qiskit Aer**: For simulating quantum circuits and error propagation.
- **Custom Scripts**: For simulating real-world failure modes and error scenarios.

## Running the Tests
To execute all tests, run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Integration with CI/CD
- Automated test suites are triggered on every commit.
- Integration tests are included as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions early.
