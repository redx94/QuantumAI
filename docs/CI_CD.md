# QuantumAI CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategy for QuantumAI. The pipeline automates testing, secure building, and deployment, ensuring robust integration of quantum and classical components.

## CI/CD Objectives
- **Automation**: Automatically run comprehensive tests on every commit.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure reliable communication between quantum simulations, AI models, and cryptographic modules.
- **Secure Deployment**: Enforce code signing, audit logging, and secret management throughout the build and deploy process.

## Example CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions
Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: QuantumAI CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Unit & Integration Tests
        run: |
          pytest tests/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t quantumai:latest .

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker tag quantumai:latest your-docker-repo/quantumai:latest
          docker push your-docker-repo/quantumai:latest

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f deployment/k8s_deployment.yaml

### Additional CI/CD Best Practices
- **Code Signing**: Ensure all build artifacts are signed to verify their integrity.
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for all CI/CD activities.
- **Secret Management**: Use secure methods to manage and store sensitive information like API keys and passwords.
- **Environment Isolation**: Maintain separate environments for development, testing, and production to avoid conflicts.
- **Automated Rollbacks**: Implement automated rollback mechanisms to revert to a stable state in case of deployment failures.
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the deployed application and CI/CD pipeline to identify bottlenecks and optimize processes.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation for the CI/CD pipeline, including configuration details, troubleshooting guides, and best practices.
