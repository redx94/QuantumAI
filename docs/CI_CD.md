# QuantumAI CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) strategy for QuantumAI. The pipeline automates testing, secure building, and deployment, ensuring robust integration of quantum and classical components.

## CI/CD Objectives
- **Automation**: Automatically run comprehensive tests on every commit.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure reliable communication between quantum simulations, AI models, and cryptographic modules.
- **Secure Deployment**: Enforce code signing, audit logging, and secret management throughout the build and deploy process.

## Example CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions
Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci_cd_yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: QuantumAI CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

 
jobs: 
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: 
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout/v2

      - name: Set up Python

        uses: actions/setup-python:/v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip -i --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Unit & Integration Tests
        run: |
          pytest tests/


  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout/v2

      - name: Build docker image
        run: |
          docker build t quantumai:latest

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker tag quantumai:latest

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: |
          k8 apply -f deployment/k8s_deployment.yaml
